Hey :)

1. Please extract all the files to the same destination, so the css file will sync with the R Markdown file.

2. We used GIF's from the web, sometimes the server of the GIF's isn't responding and an error data will appear.
   To solve this, just press "Knit" one more time, and the HTML will open properly. 

Thanks!
Paz
